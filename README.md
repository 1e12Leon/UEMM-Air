# UEMM-Air: A Synthetic Multi-modal Dataset for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Object Detection

The development of multi-modal object detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) typically relies on a large amount of pixel-aligned multi-modal image data. However, existing datasets face challenges such as limited modalities, high construction costs, and imprecise annotations. To this end, we propose a synthetic multi-modal UAV object detection datasets, UEMM-Air. Specially, we simulate various UAV flight scenarios and object types using the Unreal Engine (UE). Then we design the UAV's flight logic to automatically collect data from different scenarios, perspectives, and altitudes. Finally, we propose a novel heuristic automatic annotation algorithm to generate accurate object detection labels. In total, our UEMM-Air consists of 20k pairs of images with 5 modalities and precise annotations. The dataset are publicly available to support the research of multi-modal UAV object detection models.
